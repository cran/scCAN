Description: A single-cell Clustering method using 'Autoencoder' and Network fusion ('scCAN') for segregating the cells from the high-dimensional 'scRNA-Seq' data. The software automatically determines the optimal number of clusters and then partitions the cells in a way such that the results are robust to noise and dropouts. 'scCAN' is fast and it supports Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
